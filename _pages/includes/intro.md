I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the Institute of Network Science and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University (advised by [Prof. Yuanjie Li](http://www.yuanjiel.com/)). I received my Master’s degree in Cyberspace Security from Tsinghua University in June 2022 (advised by [Prof. Hewu Li](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1157/2451.htm)) and Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in June 2019. My research interests include satellite networking and mobile networks. My works are published at conferences or journals such as USENIX NSDI, ACM SIGCOMM, ACM MobiCom, IEEE IWQoS, and ACM HotNets.
