I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the Institute of Network Science and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University. I received my Master’s degree in Cyberspace Security from Tsinghua University in June 2022 and Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in June 2019. My research interests include computer networking, wireless and mobile network, and integrated space and terrestrial networks. My works are published at conferences or journals such as ACM SIGCOMM, IEEE IWQoS, and ACM HotNets.
