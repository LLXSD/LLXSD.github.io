PHY为MAC提供传输信道（信息如何通过无线电接口传输），MAC为RLC提供逻辑信道（所传输信息的类型），RLC为PDCP提供RLC信道，PDCP为上层提供无线承载，SDAP提供QoS Flow级别服务。

#  信道类型
The physical channels defined in the downlink are:
- the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH),
- the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH),
- the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH),

The physical channels defined in the uplink are:
- the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH),
- the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH),
- the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH).

The physical channels defined in the sidelink are:
- the Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel (PSBCH),
- the Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH),
- the Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel (PSFCH),
- the Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH).

In addition, signals are defined as **reference signals**, **primary** and **secondary synchronization signals**.

#  调制方式
The modulation schemes supported are
- in the downlink, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM, and 1024QAM,
- in the uplink, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM for OFDM with a CP and π/2-BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM,64QAM and 256QAM for DFT-s-OFDM with a CP.

#  PHY层支持的过程
- Cell search
- Power control
- Uplink synchronisation and Uplink timing control
- Random access related procedures
- HARQ related procedures
- Beam management and CSI related procedures
- Sidelink related procedures
- Channel access procedures

# 物理层测量
Radio characteristics are measured by the UE and the network and reported to higher layers. 
These include, e.g.measurements for **intra- and inter-frequency handover**, **inter RAT handover**, **timing measurements**, and measurementsfor **RRM**.
